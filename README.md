# Team4-TU-APP

## **Getting Started**

### **Download VS Code** <br>
```
https://code.visualstudio.com/download
```

### **Install GitHub on Device (Mac/Windows)** <br>
```
https://git-scm.com/downloads
```
### **Create a Project Directory**
Make sure to create a directory on your file system to store the actual project. <br>
```
C:\Users\username\Documents\VisualStudioCode\Projects

This is where mine is created/stored.
```

Navigate to Visual Studio Code and open a new terminal. Navigate to the correct directory in your terminal using "cd" and other linux commands. <br>

### **Clone the repo**
Type in the following command into the terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ib-z3aabi/Team4-TU-APP.git
```

That should clone the repo into your workspace/project folder. 

### **Create your branch**
Once your repo is cloned into your workspace, create your own branch. This is where you should do all of your work. Make sure your NEVER edit code in the "main" branch. 
```
git checkout -b [branch_name] 

//excluding the brackets.. ie. boone-1 is mine
```
